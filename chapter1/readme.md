In this chapter, you’ll learn a set of design principles that will guide you through the design and development of smart contracts and blockchain programming. You’ll apply these design principles to design a smart contract for a simple use case (a decentralized counter) and a different larger use case (for a decentralized airline consortium). To implement the design in the form of code, you need the following:

    A blockchain platform

    A language to code the smart contract

    A suitable environment to develop, compile, deploy, and test it

You’ll use the Ethereum (https://ethereum.org) blockchain as the platform and a special language called Solidity (https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2) to code the smart contracts. Then you’ll deploy the code in an integrated development environment (IDE) called Remix (https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and test its operation. This trio of technologies provides a versatile development environment and helps you ramp up the blockchain programming learning curve quickly. Starting in chapter 6, you’ll migrate from this initial environment to a production setup that will allow you to develop end-to-end Dapps and deploy them on public blockchains.
